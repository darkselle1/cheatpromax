## Open Interview Coder: Your Free AI-Powered Interview Prep Partner
Forget expensive subscription fees! Open Interview Coder delivers the essential features of premium coding interview platforms in a completely free and open-source package. By connecting your own API key, you unlock AI-driven problem analysis, solution generation, and debugging assistance, all running privately on your computer.

**Important Note:** This is a community-led project, not a commercial product. Contributions drive its development.

### Why Open Interview Coder?
The best interview prep tools often hide behind paywalls. This project breaks down that barrier, offering similar powerful features so you can:

- Utilize your own API key (pay only for your usage).
- Maintain complete privacy by running everything locally.
- Adapt the tool to your specific needs through customization.
- Learn from and contribute to an open-source initiative.

### Tailor It to Your Needs
The codebase is built for flexibility:

- **AI Model Choice**: While it defaults to OpenAI's models, you have the power to integrate other AI models like Claude, Deepseek, or Llama by modifying `/src/main/processor`.
- **Expand Language Support**: Adding more programming languages is within your reach.
- **Extend Functionality**: Dream up a new feature? You can build it.
- **Customize the UI**: Make the interface truly your own.

All you need is a basic understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript and the API of the service you want to integrate.

## Core Functionalities
- ðŸŽ¯ **Stealth Mode:** An almost invisible window that bypasses most screen capture methods.
- ðŸ“¸ **Smart Capture:** Separate capture of problem text and code for better AI analysis.
- ðŸ¤– **AI Brainpower:** Automatic problem extraction and analysis using GPT-4o.
- ðŸ’¡ **Solution Insights:** Detailed solutions with time and space complexity analysis.
- ðŸ”§ **Intelligent Debugging:** AI assistance with structured feedback for your code.
- ðŸŽ¨ **Flexible Window:** Move, resize, adjust opacity, and zoom as needed.
- ðŸ”„ **AI Model Options:** Choose between OpenAI's models or Google Gemini's models for different task.
- ðŸ”’ **Privacy First:** Your API key and data stay local, except for direct calls to OpenAI or Google Gemini.

## Global Shortcuts

## Getting Started: Installation and Development Setup
### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Node.js (v16 or higher) installed on your system.
- npm package manager.
- An active OpenAI API Key (obtainable from OpenAI) or Google Gemini API Key (obtainable from Google).
- Screen Recording Permission enabled for your Terminal/IDE:
  - **macOS:** Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Screen Recording, find Open Interview Coder, and ensure it's checked. Restart the app after enabling.
  - **Windows:** No additional permissions are required.
  - **Linux:** Depending on your distribution, you might need to grant `xhost` access.

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/xhoantran/open-interview-coder.git](https://github.com/xhoantran/open-interview-coder.git)
   cd open-interview-coder
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running in Development Mode
To start the application in a development environment:
```bash
npm run start
```

### Building for Production
To create distributable packages for your local platform:
```bash
npm run package
```
This command will package the application for your current operating system.

### Building Distributable Packages for Specific Platforms
To create installable packages for macOS (DMG) or Windows (Installer):

**For macOS (DMG):**
```bash
npm run package-mac
# Or using yarn
yarn package-mac
```

**For Windows (Installer):**
```bash
npm run package-win
# Or using yarn
yarn package-win
```

The resulting packaged applications will be located in the `release` directory.

**What the packaging scripts do:**

- Create the necessary directories for the application.
- Clean any previous build outputs.
- Build the application in production mode.
- Launch the application in its default invisible state.

### Important Considerations and Troubleshooting
- **Window Manager Conflicts:** Some window management utilities (like Rectangle Pro on macOS) might interfere with the app's window positioning. Consider temporarily disabling them if you encounter issues.
- **OpenAI API Usage:** Be mindful of your OpenAI API key's rate limits and the costs associated with different API calls, especially Vision API calls which are more expensive.
- **Custom LLM Integration:** You can explore integrating other Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Claude, Deepseek, or Grok by modifying the API calls within `/src/main/processor` and updating the UI components like `.
- **Common Issues and Solutions:**
  - If the application window doesn't appear, try toggling its visibility multiple times using `Ctrl+B`/`Cmd+B`.
  - Adjust the window's opacity using `Ctrl+[`/`Cmd+[` and `Ctrl+]`/`Cmd+]` if it seems invisible.

- OpenAI API
- Google Gemini API

## How It Works: A Functional Overview
1. **Initial Setup:** Launch the discreet window and enter your OpenAI API key in the settings. Select your preferred AI models for different stages of processing.
2. **Problem Capture:** Use `Ctrl + H`/`Cmd + H` to take screenshots of coding problems. Up to two screenshots can be queued. Remove the last one if needed by clicking on the image.
3. **AI-Powered Processing:** Press `Ctrl + Enter`/`Cmd + Enter` to send the screenshots for analysis. The AI, powered by GPT-4 Vision API, extracts the problem details. The chosen AI model then generates an optimal solution, all using your personal OpenAI API key.
4. **Solution and Debugging Insights:** Review the generated solutions with detailed explanations. For debugging, take additional screenshots of error messages or specific code sections to receive AI-driven analysis, including identified issues, corrections, and optimizations. Easily switch between viewing solutions and the screenshot queue.
5. **Window Management:** Move the window using `Ctrl + Arrow keys`/`Cmd + Arrow keys`, toggle its visibility with `Ctrl + B`/`Cmd + B`, and adjust the opacity with `Ctrl + [`/`Cmd + [` and `Ctrl + ]`/`Cmd + ]`. The window remains hidden from the specified screen sharing applications. Start a new problem session with `Ctrl + R`/`Cmd + R`.

## Extending AI Model Support
Open Interview Coder is built with extensibility in mind. You can easily add support for more LLMs beyond the default OpenAI integration:

- Integrate models like Claude, Deepseek, Grok, or any other AI with an accessible API.
- The application's architecture is designed to accommodate multiple LLM backends simultaneously.
- Users gain the flexibility to choose their preferred AI provider for different tasks.

To add a new AI model, you'll need to extend the API integration within `electron/ProcessingHelper.ts` and add the corresponding user interface options in `src/components/Settings/SettingsDialog.tsx`. The modular design aims to make this process straightforward without disrupting the existing functionality.

## Configuration Options
- **OpenAI API Key:** Your personal API key is stored locally and is exclusively used for making API calls to OpenAI.
- **AI Model Selection:** You can choose between GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini for each of these stages:
  - Problem Extraction: Analyzing screenshots to understand the coding problem.
  - Solution Generation: Creating optimized solutions with detailed explanations.
  - Debugging: Providing in-depth analysis of errors and suggestions for improvement.
- **Preferred Language:** Select your preferred programming language for the generated solutions.
- **Window Controls:** Adjust the window's opacity, position, and zoom level using the provided keyboard shortcuts.
- **Local Storage:** All your settings are stored locally within your user data directory and are preserved across application sessions.
